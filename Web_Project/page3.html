        <div class="cat">
            <p> - Almost considered as a fitness and weight loss program, Karate provides a full-body workout that targets improvements in cardiovascular capabilities, muscular toning, and stamina. There's no denying that Karate is one of the best total body workouts around. It combines cardio, endurance training, and muscles toning while burning excessive fat.

            </p>

            <p> - The most distinct and beneficial aspect of consistent training in any martial arts style is its effect on coordination and muscular communication. As you grow in experience, more and more movements and techniques will require and develop greater general coordination as well as hand-eye coordination.

                Research has demonstrated that by practicing Karate, you not only significantly improve your reflexes in the dojo but also during daily activities, such as driving.</p>

                <p> - By participating in Karate, you can tone and improve the amount of muscle mass you have in your body. Karate training will strengthen and develop almost every muscle in your body. Trust me.

                    By doing lots of pushups, abdominals and training positions like the horse stance (kiba dachi) or the front stance (zenkutsu dachi) will definitely help you gain some muscles mass which will in return lead to an increase in your overall agility, thereby preventing the risk of falling as you age.</p>

                    <p>Since Karate provides a full-body workout, it will naturally increase your overall stamina and endurance. Karate training methods, including striking, blocking and body-weight exercises, are designed to get the body to develop stamina as it requires a lot of energy.</p>

                    <p>Generally, a Karate class includes about 15 to 20 minutes of warming and stretching exercises before every session. As you know, stretching is extremely important before any kind of exercise, including Karate.

                        Stretching, kicking and other Karate movements will help to increase muscle and joint flexibility so that you can do various postures, exercises and movements better over time. If you keep stretching, you will see gradual, but substantial, improvement over time.</p>
