           <p> - Personally, wrestling has had one of the biggest influences on my life. From mindset to physical attributes and everything in between, I can draw a line to the sport of wrestling with how it's improved my life. </p>

            <p> - If I were to explain it to a parent looking to put their son or daughter on the mat, there are five things I’d pinpoint as some of the biggest benefits of wrestling.

            </p>

            <p> - You will be absolutely pushed to the brink in this sport; that’s no secret. And without conquering the obstacle mentally there is no way you can overcome it physically.</p>

            <p> - Competing without confidence can be a recipe for disaster. It holds you back and keeps you from progressing. The work you put in on the mat will also give you confidence off the mat as well.</p>            
 
            <p> - Not every benefit happens between the ears of a wrestler; some come physically. As mentioned before, the discipline from a consistent diet and training regimen will ultimately benefit in gaining high levels of physical fortitude.</p>

            <p> - By definition this is a tailor-made byproduct of wrestling. You become a family with the teammates you spend so much time with. </p>
