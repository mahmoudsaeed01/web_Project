           <p> - How many times have you promised yourself you’d exercise after work? By the time you get home from working all day, commuting in traffic, and making dinner, it’s pretty clear working out isn’t on the to-do list. Yes, there are some people who enthusiastically workout no matter how long their day has been. But for employees who struggle with fitness, having an onsite gym makes it easier to exercise daily, especially if a coworker acts as a fitness accountability partner as well.</p>

            <p> - Employees who exercise daily are healthier mentally and physically. From weight loss to stronger bones and joints, exercise improves the human body’s function. Plus, proper nutrition and exercise means less visits to the doc and more successful work days. Some studies report as little as 20 minutes of exercise can reduce the risk of developing serious, chronic issues like diabetes or heart disease. Promoting wellness programs with an onsite gym to back the initiatives up makes it clear to employees that healthy living matters.</p>

            <p> - When a team feels taken care of, they tend to put in more effort at work. Providing an opportunity for colleagues to connect outside of a formal work environment fosters healthy personal and professional relationships. By providing a private gym for employees, companies show proof they want to see workers thrive beyond the workspace.

            </p>
            <p> - It’s no secret that stress wreaks havoc on the human body. Stressed out employees often take more mental health days, turn to emotional eating, and skip over important doctors’ visits. Reports show exercise helps improve mental health by providing clarity to better handle stress effectively.

                Exercise reduces cortisol levels (the body’s stress hormone) while sweating releases endorphins that help your mind relax. Instead of reaching for the office sweets, an onsite gym can help employees reach new fitness goals.</p>
